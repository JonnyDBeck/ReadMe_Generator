# Liberties
This project was pretty straightfoward for the most part, however I went a little overboard with the licenses.
Every single license I could find is included here which added a sizeable amount of code to my application.
Furthermore I had deleted and developed some of my own functions to make the code flow smoother and easier on the eyes
